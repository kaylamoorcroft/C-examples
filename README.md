Showcasing example programs that I made while learning C. These are mostly for assignments at university.  

### problem-solving-c

I took a class for computer programming for Applied Science (Engineering) in C. 
This was an introductory class to programming for those with no background in it. 
Since I had previous experience in python, java and C#, this was mostly just a "learn the syntax of C" class for me.
This course focused on problem-solving through code.

### more-advanced-c

I took another class in C, but this was directed at those who had completed the introductory coding classes for python and java (focus on object oriented programming).
In addition to the syntax, we learned more about procedural programming languages in general and the history of C. 
This is the first class that required us to use the terminal and command line to compile and run our code. 
So many of the assignments stem around these principles as well - this includes things like using makefiles for compilation, not coding in an IDE to better learn C etc.

This repository contains assignments I completed from both of these classes which showcase various skills related to coding in C.
