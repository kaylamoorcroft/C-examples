# Basics

This is kind of a trivial assignment, but it was the first one after all. The purpose was to write basic C code and get used to using makefiles. 

We had to make a program for different control structures (for loop, do while loop, while loop, if statements, switch) to show that we know how to use them in C. For all the programs (except switch), had to read in a number from the user and do something based on the input. For the switch program, we read in a char and did something based on the input and had a case-insensitive menu.  

Because this seems like a kind of boring assignment, I decided to make it more interesting (and fun) for myself by making programs that actually do something instead of just use the control statement...

So I made:
- A number guessing game (do-while.c) - this was my favourite one to make!
- Creating a pyramid of the user's requested size (for.c)
- Determining if a number is positive / negative / neutral (if.c) - this is the most boring one in my opinion...
- Diary / journal entry simulator (switch.c)
- Computing the area of a square based on side length input (while.c) - in this case, the while loop is used for input validation.
