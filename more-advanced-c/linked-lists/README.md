program.c contains all functions and program with menu selection

Instead of inputting values manually, you can pass in testing.txt as input to 
see how the program would function. ie, run "make" then "a7 < testing.txt" to 
see sample output.

Here is what is what the input is actually doing in testing.txt:
- adding values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to end of list
- printing out list
- adding value 100 to postiion 2
- adding value 0 to postiion 0
- adding value 2 to end of list
- printing out list
- printing out list in reverse
- deleting first '2' from list
- deleting node in position 2
- printing out list
- deleting node in position 0
- printing out list
- printing out list in reverse
- deleting node in position 3
- printing out list
- quitting program
