Creating an array that can store mixed elements of ints, floats and strings.

Unions are used to store different data types under 1 variable. 
An enumerated type is used to keep track of the data type in the union.
These two are combined into a struct to fully form a data type that can hold either an int, float or string.
Then, there are functions in the program for working with arrays of these structs.
