# Conditional compilation
Here I practice using conditional compilation (macros) along with makefiles to perform certain tasks in a program based on the compilation instructions.

The program reads input and creates output based on which task is run:
> Task 1 - "filter" - outputs exactly what is entered, character by character
> Task 2 - "switched" - swaps uppercase and lowercase letters - if uppercase, make lowercase, and if lowercase, make uppercase.
> Task 3 - "reversed" - prints out the entire text backwards  

The default input and output stream is the command line, but a file can be redirected to be input or output if desired.
