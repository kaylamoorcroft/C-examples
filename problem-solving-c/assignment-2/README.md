# Assignment 2

#### Part A: law-of-sines.c

Prompt the user for the magnitudes of three angles in degrees (A, B, C), and one side (a) of a triangle, and then uses the supplied values to calculate and display the magnitude of the remaining sides (b and c), using the Law of Sines. The area of the triangle will also be calculated.

#### Part B: survey.c

Ask a user to respond to 3 questions by ranking level of agreement on a scale of 1 to 5. The survey is set up so that 5 means the user fully supports the statement, down to 1 which represents a user not supporting the statement. The sum of the answers will relate to a message that is displayed on the screen (whether the user supports the project, doesn't support it, or is neutral about it).

We also had to write pseudocode for this program before starting to code it.
